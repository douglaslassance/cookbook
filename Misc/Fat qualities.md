When buying oils, look for the following words:Â 

- Cold Pressed
- Extra Virgin
- Expeller Pressed

It basically means the oils are not processed through heating, which typically oxidizes the oils and is bad for you.

Not all fat is made equal, especially when it comes to taste and heating. Choose the right oil for the right job.
